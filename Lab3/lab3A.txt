Programming Problem One

Write a C++ program that prompts the user to enter the number of credit hours earned sofar and displays his/her corresponding category:

Freshman: students with <= 15 credit hours earned
Sophomore: 15 < credit hours earned <= 45
Junior: 45 < credit hours earned <= 75
Senior: 75 < credit hours earned
If the user input is not valid, i.e., credit hours entered < 0, an error message should be displayed. You are required to use the multi-way decision statement, i.e., the if-else if-else, statement for this problem.

Here are a few example runs of the program:

Sample run 1

Please enter your total credit hours earned: 30

You are a Sophomore.

Sample run 2

Please enter your total credit hours earned: 82

You are a Senior.

Sample run 3

Please enter your total credit hours earned: 12

You are a Freshman.

Sample run 4

Please enter your total credit hours earned: -10

Invalid input.
